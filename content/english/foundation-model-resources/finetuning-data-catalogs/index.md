details: "Finetuning data is used to hone a model's specific capabilities, orient it to a certain task, improve its responses to instructions, mitigate harmful or unhelpful behaviors, and/or align it to human preferences. Given the thousands of specialized data sources for finetuning, we recommend using data catalogs that provide well documented datasets."
