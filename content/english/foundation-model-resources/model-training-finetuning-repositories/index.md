details: "Fine-tuning, or other types of adaptation performed on foundation models after pretraining, are an equally important and complex step in model development. Fine-tuned models are more frequently deployed than base models. Here, we also link to some useful and widely-used resources for adapting foundation models or otherwise fine-tuning them."
