details: "Model releases often go accompanied with claims on evaluation performance, but those results are not always reproducible, or can be misleading. If code is not released, is not comprehensive, is difficult to run, or misses key details, this will cost the scientific community time and effort to replicate and verify the claims. Replication time will also slow progress, and discourage developers from adopting that resource over others."
