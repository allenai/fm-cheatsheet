details: "When releasing new data resources with a model, it is important to thoroughly document the data. Documentation allows users to understand its intended uses, legal restrictions, attribution, relevant contents, privacy concerns, and other limitations. Many data documentation standards have been proposed, but their adoption has been uneven. Crowdsourced documentation may contain errors and omissions."
