details: "Practitioners should consider using already-optimized codebases, especially in the pre-training phase, to ensure effective use of computational resources, capital, power, and effort. Existing open-source codebases targeted at foundation model pretraining can be significantly more accessible to new practitioners and help contribute to efficient training strategies."
