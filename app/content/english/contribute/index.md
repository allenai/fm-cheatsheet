## Add to Cheatsheet

To contribute resources to the cheatsheet, please review the Criteria for Inclusion below, and the Add Resource Instructions.

### Criteria for Inclusion:

The resources are selected based on a literature review for each phase of foundation model development.
Inclusion is predicated on: the **perceived helpfulness as a development tool**, the **extent and quality of the documentation**, 
and the **insights brought to the development process**.

Please ensure your candidate resource will meaningfully aid *responsible* development practices.
While we do accept academic literature as a resource, this cheatsheet focuses on tools, such as data catalogs, 
search/analysis tools, evaluation repositories, and, selectively, literature that summarizes, surveys, or guides important development decisions.

We will review suggested contributions and (optionally) acknowledge contributors to this cheatsheet on the website 
and in future work.

### Add Resource Instructions:

* Option 1: Use this [upload form](https://forms.gle/aAa2dismSzCpae4p6) to contribute a resource.
* Option 2: Bulk upload resources by creating a pull request in this repository, extending `app/resources/resources.jsonl`.

> In both cases, it is essential that the requested documentation on each resource is accurate and complete.
